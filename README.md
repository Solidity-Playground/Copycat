# Copycat
Mint token proxies that return the contents of other NFTs
An ERC721 that inherits its properties from another ERC721 you own.

Mint proxy tokens that are mapped to other tokens in other contracts on the same chain
tokenURI is inherited from the origin NFT
Only works if you own the destination token
